## Hello

I have been involved in crypto technologies since 2019 and have been following the developments in this field on a day-to-day basis. 
I strive to stay informed about every trend and innovation. Throughout this process, I have been part of various communities and served as a community manager. My name is HÃ¼seyin Uzun. 
I am passionate about decentralization and the advancement of blockchain technologies, which is why I participate in most mainnets and testnets, even without incentives, to contribute to their development. Apart from that, I contribute to the ecosystem of emerging networks by launching Explorers, Node monitors, or NFT projects on those networks.

Below are the Testnet and Mainnet Nodes I have participated in:
